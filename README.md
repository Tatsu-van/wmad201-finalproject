# wmad201-finalproject

<h1>What did I create?</h1>
<p> --> I created simple blog site using django</p>

<h1>What did I learn?</h1>
<p> --> How to exchange information with the server.</p>

<h1>What was the most difficult or particular aspect of the project?</h1>
<p> --> creating a category list and a tag list to search posts which have those categries or tags</p>

<h1>Feature challenges</h1>
<p> --> To be honest, I couldn't make it by myself, I referred to the class assignments, researched and applied them, so I would like to deepen my knowledge even more before the future</p>

<h3>Thank you, Francois</h3>
